# Mobile App Development

This app is a simple introduction test to mobile development created for the Software Development Skills: Mobile [LUT university](https://www.lut.fi/en)  course. I created a pokemon app that loads a list of 8 pokemon using the Pokemon API. The user can click on a pokemon name to see an animated gif of the pokemon that opens in a different view.
Also I added a button to load another 8 pokemons.
